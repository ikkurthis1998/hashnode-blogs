# Flex Box

Hi, Flex Box is one of the ways to create beautiful layouts for a web page/ web app.

You can convert an element into flex-box container by setting display property to flex.
Once an element is defined as flex-box, the items inside the flex-box container becomes flex-items.
By default these items are arranged horizontally.
The direction of arrangement can be changed to vertical by setting flex-direction property to column.

Once the flex-direction property is set, the axis along which the flex-direction is set is called 𝑀𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝐴𝑥𝑖𝑠 and the one perpendicular to it is called 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐴𝑥𝑖𝑠.
